## Usage

To use the confluence-markdown-exporter, follow these steps:

### 1. Installation

Install python package via pip.

```sh
pip install confluence-markdown-exporter
```

### 2. Exporting

Run the exporter with the desired Confluence page ID or space key. Execute the console application by typing `confluence-markdown-exporter` and one of the commands `pages`, `pages-with-descendants`, `spaces`, `all-spaces` or `config`. If a command is unclear, you can always add `--help` to get additional information. 

> [!TIP]
> Instead of `confluence-markdown-exporter` you can also use the shorthand `cf-export`.

#### 2.1. Export Page

Export a single Confluence page by ID:

```sh
confluence-markdown-exporter pages <page-id e.g. 645208921> <output path e.g. ./output_path/>
```

or by URL:

```sh
confluence-markdown-exporter pages <page-url e.g. https://company.atlassian.net/MySpace/My+Page+Title> <output path e.g. ./output_path/>
```

#### 2.2. Export Page with Descendants

Export a Confluence page and all its descendant pages by page ID:

```sh
confluence-markdown-exporter pages-with-descendants <page-id e.g. 645208921> <output path e.g. ./output_path/>
```

or by URL:

```sh
confluence-markdown-exporter pages-with-descendants <page-url e.g. https://company.atlassian.net/MySpace/My+Page+Title> <output path e.g. ./output_path/>
```

Exclude specific pages (and their descendants) by ID using --ignore (comma-separated IDs):

```sh
cf-export pages-with-descendants 645208921 --ignore 12345,67890
```

#### 2.3. Export Space

Export all Confluence pages of a single Space:

```sh
confluence-markdown-exporter spaces <space-key e.g. MYSPACE> <output path e.g. ./output_path/>
```

#### 2.3. Export all Spaces

Export all Confluence pages across all spaces:

```sh
confluence-markdown-exporter all-spaces <output path e.g. ./output_path/>
```

### 3. Output

The exported Markdown file(s) will be saved in the specified `output` directory e.g.:

```sh
output_path/
└── MYSPACE/
   ├── MYSPACE.md
   └── MYSPACE/
      ├── My Confluence Page.md
      └── My Confluence Page/
            ├── My nested Confluence Page.md
            └── Another one.md
```

## Configuration

All configuration and authentication is stored in a single JSON file managed by the application. You do not need to manually edit this file.

### Interactive Configuration

To interactively view and change configuration, run:

```sh
confluence-markdown-exporter config
```

This will open a menu where you can:
- See all config options and their current values
- Select a config to change (including authentication)
- Reset all config to defaults
- Navigate directly to any config section (e.g. `auth.confluence`)

### Available Configuration Options

You can always view and change the current config with the interactive menu above.

### Configuration for Target Systems

Some platforms have specific requirements for Markdown formatting, file structure, or metadata. You can adjust the export configuration to optimize output for your target system. Below are some common examples:

#### Obsidian

- **Document Title**: Obsidian already displays the document title. Ensure `export.include_document_title` is `False` so the documented title is not redundant.
- **Breadcrumbs**: Obsidian already displays page breadcrumbs. Ensure `export.breadcrumbs` is `False` so the breadcrumbs are not redundant.

#### Azure DevOps (ADO) Wikis

- **Absolute Attachment Links**: Ensure `export.attachment_href` is set to `absolute`.
- **Attachment Path Template**: Set `export.attachment_path` to  `.attachments/{attachment_file_id}{attachment_extension}` so ADO Wiki can find attachments.
- **Filename sanitizing**: 
    - Set `export.filename_encoding` to `" ":"-","\"":"%22","*":"%2A","-":"%2D",":":"%3A","<":"%3C",">":"%3E","?":"%3F","|":"%7C","\\":"_","#":"_","/":"_","\u0000":"_"` 
      for ADO compatibility (spaces become `-`, dashes become `%2D`, and forbidden characters become `_`)
    - Set `export.filename_length` to `200`

### Custom Config File Location

By default, configuration is stored in a platform-specific application directory. You can override the config file location by setting the `CME_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to the desired file path. If set, the application will read and write config from this file instead. Example:

```sh
export CME_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/your/custom_config.json
```

This is useful for using different configs for different environments or for scripting.

## Update

Update python package via pip.

```sh
pip install confluence-markdown-exporter --upgrade
```

## Compatibility

This package is not tested extensively. Please check all output and report any issue [here](https://github.com/Spenhouet/confluence-markdown-exporter/issues).
It generally was tested on:
- Confluence Cloud 1000.0.0-b5426ab8524f (2025-05-28)
- Confluence Server 8.5.20

## Known Issues
1. **Missing Attachment File ID on Server**: For some Confluence Server version/configuration the attachment file ID might not be provided (https://github.com/Spenhouet/confluence-markdown-exporter/issues/39). In the default configuration, this is used for the export path. Solution: Adjust the attachment path in the export config and use the `{attachment_id}` or `{attachment_title}` instead.
2. **Connection Issues when behind Proxy or VPN**: There might be connection issues if your Confluence Server is behind a proxy or VPN (https://github.com/Spenhouet/confluence-markdown-exporter/issues/38). If you experience issues, help to fix this is appreciated.
